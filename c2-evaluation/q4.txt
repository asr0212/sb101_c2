Q .1 Normalization:
==>  normalize is a process in which we avoid data inconsistency and redundency for better database.
     or to avoid data anomly.
     there is three type of anomly UPDATE, INSERT and DELET;
     
     for example if in a person table where we have two rows for same person it makes anomly;
    
     to avoid this kind of situation we use normalization.

Q 2. 2NF:

==>  to make a table in 2NF form we want to condotion:
     1. tabble should be in 1NF form
     2. non prime data should not be dependent to primary key or prime data.
     
     if we have a table where a person have to emails
     then in 1NF form we have two rows for that person.
     and person age also in these 2 rows so it's not 2NF form
     
     for acheive 2NF we have to split in 2 tables
     where in 1st table we can have primary key and age for every person in single row
     and in 2nd table we dont have to add age coloum.
